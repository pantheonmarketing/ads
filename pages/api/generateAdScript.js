  Write two variations of a Facebook ad caption using the following information:

  Avatar and Their Problem: ${avatar}
  Desired Outcome: ${desiredOutcome}
  Ineffective Method 1: ${ineffectiveMethod1}
  Ineffective Method 2: ${ineffectiveMethod2}
  Ineffective Method 3: ${ineffectiveMethod3}
  New Solution Name: ${newSolution}

  Please write each ad copy variation in this format:

  Variation 1:
  Line 1: ðŸ“ž CALLING ALL [AVATAR + THEIR PAIN]: [achieve your desired outcome] with this NEW METHOD...
  Line 2: I understand that you may have already tried:
  - [Ineffective Method 1]
  - [Ineffective Method 2]
  - Or even - [Ineffective Method 3]
  Line 3: But you're still seeing no progress towards [desired outcome].
  Line 4: That's why I want to introduce you to [new solution name].
  Line 5: As of 2024, it's the fastest and easiest way to [desired outcome].
  Line 6: If you're interested in learning moreâ€¦
  Line 7: You can access it right here: [INSERT LINK]

  Variation 2:
  [Create a different approach using the same information but with a unique angle or hook]

  Make sure both ad copy variations are engaging, persuasive, and tailored to the specific avatar and their problem. Use emojis where appropriate to make the ads more visually appealing.
